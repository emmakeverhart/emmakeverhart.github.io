            I am currently a student at Virginia Tech studying Marketing. This website contains some of the work I have completed in my digital media course including a blog post, podcast, and video. Through each assignment shows some of my interests, personality, and things that I have learned throughout this course.

          <h2>Blog Post: Are Our Phones Listening To Us? Yes, But Not in The Way Youâ€™re Thinking.</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Where do you go when you have a quick question or need a quick recipe? Who do you lean on for advice on how to live a healthy life? It may be an important role model or friend in your life. But my guess is, you go to the one thing attached by your side, your <a href="https://medium.com/@eke_59902/are-our-phones-listening-to-us-yes-but-not-in-the-way-youre-thinking-3ff9547f0ddc" target="_blank">phone</a>.

          <h2>Podcast: Effects of Streaming Services on Socialization</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I am sure you all have heard the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atul-bharadwaj-664093970/cables-to-streaming?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank">Netflix</a> intro. That sound probably reminds you of curling up in your bed on weekends and binge-watching your favorite shows. But when was the last time that sound reminded you of your family? You probably need to think a little hard about that one. Streaming services are booming, outselling box offices and giving people so many reasons to drop their cable subscriptions. With this drive away from leaving the house to watch movies, we should be closer than ever right, but are we really? Stay tuned to know about it.
